# MemoryCheck
This is a simple memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where players match pairs of cricketer cards. The game features a grid of cards containing images of cricketers. Players can flip over two cards at a time to reveal the cricketers and attempt to match pairs. The game continues until all pairs have been matched.
